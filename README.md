# CPU Visualizer

Bash script that visualizes CPU usage (Linux machines only).

Based on this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fixlWcKWV8) by You Suck at Programming.
In addition, I've added a "total" CPU bar and re-arranged some of the code from the video to my personal preferences.

## Running

To run, from a bash (or supported) shell you'll want to give execution permissions to the script if necessary:

```
chmod +x ~/path/to/script/cpu
```

Then execute. CTRL + C to stop the process.

```
.~/path/to/script/cpu
```
